This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location.

You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3.

In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Next, tap the <strong>Ellipsis</strong> (three dots) icon at the top-right corner of the screen and choose <strong>Chat Info</strong>. Alternatively, simply swipe the screen to the left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-2.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber, tap chat info"                ></p><p>Step 3. On the Chat Info window, simply enable or disable the <strong>Attach location always</strong> toggle. It’s done!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-3.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber to allow location sharing"                ></p><p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: You might be wondering how to share your actual Viber location with a chat or group. Again, this is very straightforward. Simply open the conversation and tap the three dots on the text field. Then, click the <strong>Share Location</strong> button and choose your location on the Google map. Lastly, tap <strong>Send location</strong> to share the Viber location with your selected contact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-4.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber share location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-send-a-fake-location-on-Viber-and-How"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-send-a-fake-location-on-Viber-and-How" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?"></a>Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?</h2><p>So, is it possible to <strong>Viber’s fake location</strong>? Unfortunately, Viber doesn’t allow users to share a different place from the real one. That’s because the app asks to automatically access your actual location data using Wi-Fi or GPS while signing up. Therefore, based on the permission you set yourself, the answer is NO.</p><p>But nothing is impossible in the tech world. You can easily instruct Viber to share a different location using a third-party app or service like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Let’s discuss some reasons to spoof location on this messaging app. Below are some common ones:</p><ul><li><strong>Protect your privacy</strong></li></ul><p> Many people don’t want other online users to have a clue of their actual whereabouts. If you’re one of them, use a third-party tool to spoof your Viber location on your Tecno Spark Go (2023) or Android.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank your friends</strong></li></ul><p>Do you want to show your friends that you’re in London or New York when you’re in some remote village&#x2F;town somewhere in reality? Yes, that sounds cool!</p><ul><li><strong>Improve sales</strong></li></ul><p>If you’re a digital marketer, you might want to convince your potential clients that the goods are from a specific region or city close to them. Believe it or not, this can lead to more sales closures.</p><h3 id="Wrap-it-Up"><a href="#Wrap-it-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it Up"></a>Wrap it Up</h3><p>You can share your live location on Viber just like you would on Facebook, WhatsApp, and other social media apps.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3.

In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger.

Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

It will ensure that no one, even your friends can see your Facebook dating profile. This hiding of the dating profile is automatic. So, don’t expect your friends who are using Facebook dating to notice that you are using the platform. In the same vein, don’t expect to see your friends who are using Facebook Dating.</p><h3 id="2-What-happens-when-you-like-someone-on-Facebook-Dating"><a href="#2-What-happens-when-you-like-someone-on-Facebook-Dating" class="headerlink" title="2. What happens when you like someone on Facebook Dating?"></a>2. What happens when you like someone on Facebook Dating?</h3><p>If you notice a profile that matches what you are looking for, Facebook Dating requires you to do something about it. You can choose to begin a conversation by either tapping the person’s photo or hitting the love icon. Let’s elaborate on how you do either of the two.</p><p><strong>Sending a Like</strong></p><ul><li>Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.</li><li>From the choices displayed, select the “Dating” Option.</li><li>Tap the love icon to send the like.</li></ul><p><strong>Starting a conversation</strong></p><ul><li>Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.</li><li>From the choices displayed, select the “Dating” Option.</li><li>Tap the photo, write a message you deem fit, and send it.</li></ul><p>It is important to note that what happens after that solely depends on the other party. If you send them a like, they have to send a like back for a conversation to commence. But, equally important, the other person has to reply to your message for you to start a conversation.</p><h3 id="3-How-do-you-know-if-someone-is-on-Facebook-Dating"><a href="#3-How-do-you-know-if-someone-is-on-Facebook-Dating" class="headerlink" title="3. How do you know if someone is on Facebook Dating?"></a>3. How do you know if someone is on Facebook Dating?</h3><p>One must admit that knowing whether someone is on Facebook Dating can be quite hard. After all, the feature automatically hides its users’ profiles. The simplest way of finding out is to rely on luck. Go ahead and join Facebook Dating and then wait for Facebook Dating to suggest that person. There are high chances of waiting long before knowing whether someone is on Facebook Dating. If they change their Facebook dating location, there is a possibility of never knowing.</p><p>That said and done, there are other more specific ways of identifying if that person is using Facebook Dating. If you can access their phone, grab it and check Facebook notifications. If you notice the likes of someone who liked you or has a crush on you, then that’s a Facebook Dating user. If the person doesn’t mind answering, go straight to the point and ask them. Other alternatives include spying on their phones and using online tools.</p><h3 id="4-Can-someone-see-once-you-read-a-message-sent-via-Facebook-Dating"><a href="#4-Can-someone-see-once-you-read-a-message-sent-via-Facebook-Dating" class="headerlink" title="4.Can someone see once you read a message sent via Facebook Dating?"></a>4.Can someone see once you read a message sent via Facebook Dating?</h3><p>Unfortunately, Facebook Dating doesn’t support read receipts. Your option is to keep waiting for the response until they respond or hope to forget about it altogether. For someone genuinely interested, the wait can be pretty frustrating. It could mean that the other parties are genuinely busy or not interested. If the case is the latter, the other party will most likely see the message and ignore it. Please tell him whether they have yet to see your message or chose not to respond.</p><h3 id="5-How-anonymous-is-a-Facebook-Dating-profile"><a href="#5-How-anonymous-is-a-Facebook-Dating-profile" class="headerlink" title="5. How anonymous is a Facebook Dating profile?"></a>5. How anonymous is a Facebook Dating profile?</h3><p>Seeing someone’s Facebook Dating profile can be a daunting task. Despite that being the case, anonymity is something you can’t expect from this platform. If someone gets lucky and sees your dating profile, recognizing you are pretty high. After all, your profile displays the name you use on Facebook.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>It is an excellent way of meeting new friends who live outside your residence area. In addition to that, you can also use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to fake your location when using other social media platforms, games, and dating sites.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Since dr.fone doesn’t support Android devices for now, we will help the users with a well-known Android app to serve the purpose, and it is FGL Pro. This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> As mentioned, firstly, downgrade the Google Play services. Then, install the app in your Honor X50i.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once installed, make sure to disable the “Find My Device” option. You can do this by “Settings” &gt; “Security” &gt; “Device Administrations” and turn off the option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg"                      alt="android version about fgl pro"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Another thing to be noted after downgrading Google Play services is to uninstall the updates. Simply head to “Settings” &gt; “Apps” &gt; “menu” &gt; “Show System” &gt; “Google Play Services” &gt; “Uninstall Updates”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg"                      alt="fgl steps"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, install the older Google Play Services version that you downgraded earlier. Head to “File Explorer” &gt; “Downloads” and click apk file of Google Play Services. Tap “Install”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg"                      alt="tap install"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, go to “Settings” &gt; “Apps” and tap the menu. Choose “Show System” &gt; “Google Play Store” and disable it.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Now, you need to set the FGL Pro as a mock location app. Please make sure to enable Developer options first. Then, in the menu of Developer Options, select “Select mock location app” &gt; “FGL Pro”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg"                      alt="set fgl as mock location app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Open the app now and set the desired location. Tap on the “Play” button, and you’re good to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-11.jpg"                      alt="tap on play button"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Using-VPN"><a href="#Method-2-Using-VPN" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using VPN"></a>Method 2: Using VPN</h3><p>The second effective method to Snapchat fake location is through the help of a VPN. There are a lot of options when it comes to VPN. However, you can choose Surshark if you can’t decide whether it is one of the best VPN that comes with build-in fake GPS tech. It is the cheapest and the VPN that provides you with the perfect way to enhance your Snapchat experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-12.jpg"                      alt="use vpn for snapchat location"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Using-Xcode"><a href="#Method-3-Using-Xcode" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using Xcode"></a>Method 3: Using Xcode</h3><p>The third method of fake GPS for Snapchat includes Xcode. Through Xcode, you could easily change the Snapchat location. Steps to a fake location with Xcode includes:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In the first step, you must install Xcode from the Macs app store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-13.jpg"                      alt="xcode for snapchat location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Launch it and set up a project. Choose “Single View Application” and click “Next”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-14.jpg"                      alt="xcode steps"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Provide a name to the project and hit “Next”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-15.jpg"                      alt="provide a name"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, you must set up GIT on Xcode. You will notice a screen showing “Please tell me where you are” and the commands.</p><p>You are required to enter the commands in “Terminal”. Open it and type the following:</p><ul><li>git config –global user.email “<a class="link"   href="mailto:&#x79;&#x6f;&#117;&#64;&#x65;&#120;&#97;&#109;&#112;&#108;&#x65;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;" >&#x79;&#x6f;&#117;&#64;&#x65;&#120;&#97;&#109;&#112;&#108;&#x65;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“</li><li>git config –global user.name “your name”</li></ul><p><strong>Please note:</strong> “<a class="link"   href="mailto:&#x79;&#111;&#117;&#64;&#x65;&#x78;&#97;&#109;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;" >&#x79;&#111;&#117;&#64;&#x65;&#x78;&#97;&#109;&#x70;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#109; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>” and “your name” should be changed with your info.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-16.jpg"                      alt="enter the commands"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Connect your Honor X50i to Mac and wait as Xcode will begin to process some files.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You can now click on “Debug” menu and choose “Simulate Location”. Choose the desired location now and fake GPS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-17.jpg"                      alt="click on debug"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-What-to-pay-attention-to-while-faking-Snapchat-location"><a href="#Part-3-What-to-pay-attention-to-while-faking-Snapchat-location" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What to pay attention to while faking Snapchat location?"></a>Part 3: What to pay attention to while faking Snapchat location?</h2><p>There is a certain risk that you may face while using a fake GPS Snapchat map, so you must pay attention while faking Snapchat location. Some of the fake location tools could simulate latitude and longitude perfectly but do not simulate altitude, which may sometime ban your account in Snapchat. Hence you must choose the best tool that could spoof any location without any range limitation.</p><p>Some of the Snapchat spoof does not work immediately and may also provide you with some difficulty. Hence here you must wait for some time or restart the Honor X50i device and recheck it.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Many different tools could help you to spoof Snapchat. But you must always prefer to choose the right one that could perfectly meet your needs.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport.

Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else’s mobile phone or device.</p><p>Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees’ devices or kids’ phones.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

First launched in 2013, Yik Yak went into haze in 2017 after receiving harsh criticism due to its poor privacy policies. However, after four years of complete shutdown, Yik Yak was relaunched in 2021 with improved security features and functionality.</p><p>Ever since its relaunch in August last year, many users on Yik Yak have been looking for ways to change their location to meet people in other cities&#x2F;states. So keep reading if you’ve been trying to find solutions to swap locations in Yik Yak. In today’s guide, we will share the best ways to <strong>change the Yik Yak location</strong> and connect with people from different corners of the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-you-should-know-about-Yik-Yak"><a href="#Part-1-What-you-should-know-about-Yik-Yak" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What you should know about Yik Yak"></a>Part 1: What you should know about Yik Yak</h2><p>If you are not familiar with Yik Yak, here’s what you need to know. Yik Yak is a one-of-a-kind social media platform designed to help users connect with people through text-based posts. In addition, users can anonymously post content and interact with other users in the same location.</p><p>Yik Yak also has a dedicated “Peek” feature that allows users to explore what people are talking about a particular topic in different locations. Even though Yik Yak has limited features compared to other social media apps like Instagram and Snapchat, Yik Yak still has its fair share of a fan base. People love Yik Yak for its anonymity and enjoy meeting new like-minded people.</p><p>Now, users look for ways to change location on Yik Yak to meet people from different areas. By default, users can only see posts from their current location, and after a while, their feed starts to look pretty repetitive. But, by changing their places, they can expand their radar and find new posts from the desired locations.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-On-Yik-Yak"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-On-Yik-Yak" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location On Yik Yak"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location On Yik Yak</h2><p>So, what are the different ways to change location on Yik Yak? Since Yik Yak uses your phone’s GPS sensors to detect the current location, you’ll have to manipulate the GPS signals to get the job done. To do this, you can use different methods such as:</p><h3 id="1-Using-the-peek-feature-to-view-other-local-Yik-Yak-groups-or-communities"><a href="#1-Using-the-peek-feature-to-view-other-local-Yik-Yak-groups-or-communities" class="headerlink" title="1. Using the peek feature to view other local Yik Yak groups or communities"></a>1. Using the peek feature to view other local Yik Yak groups or communities</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, Peek is the built-in feature of Yik Yak that allows users to find out what people are saying about a particular topic in different locations.</p><p>However, this feature has a few limitations. First, even though you’ll be able to explore posts from other locations, you won’t be able to react to them. A user can only respond to posts in his particular area. So, “Peek” would only be a suitable solution for exploring posts from other locations, but not changing the Yik Yak location itself.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-to-fake-GPS-location"><a href="#2-Use-Dr-Fone-Virtual-Location-to-fake-GPS-location" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to fake GPS location"></a>2. Use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to fake GPS location</h3><p>If you are looking for an effective way to change your location in Yik Yak, we recommend using a professional GPS simulator like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. It’s a cross-platform geo spoofing tool with a built-in teleport mode. With the “Teleport Mode” feature, you’ll be able to change your location to anywhere in the world with a single click.</p><p>It means you’ll be able to publish your own Yik Yak posts from different locations and react to someone else’s posts without interruptions. Apart from Yik Yak, you can also use a tool like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to manipulate GPS signals in other location-based apps like Pokemon Go or Tinder.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

If your group has a mix of Android, iOS, and Blackberry, this app is excellent for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/find-my-friends.jpg"                      alt="find my friends"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Familo"><a href="#2-2-Familo" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Familo"></a>2.2 Familo</h3><p>Familo is the best working “finding friend” app. The app is regularly updated, and you can sign up with a phone number. You don’t need Facebook or any username to use this app. You have to create a group and invite others. If they sign up, you will get their location details at any time of the day. Of course, they have to approve it first!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/familio-app.jpg"                      alt="familio app"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Glympse"><a href="#2-3-Glympse" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Glympse"></a>2.3 Glympse</h3><p>What makes Glympse different from others is the fact that you don’t even need to sign up here! You can set up a group for a specific time, and share your location to anyone you want to. You can even share your places via the web. If you wish to track your friends temporarily or contact someone for a specific period, Glympse is the right choice for you. And, if someone is not comfortable with the idea of location sharing, you can send your location via the web. They can use the shared link to know your area without ever installing the app. But, if you want to check up on your loved ones continually, then Glympse cannot satisfy your demand. As a temporary service, your location sharing link will be activated for four hours at most.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/glympse-app.jpg"                      alt="glympse app"                ></p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Remember, there are several other find my friends apps in the app store, which can entice you. Some of them have pretty neat features. But, they can drain your battery too fast; others can be pretty limited on their free version. And, many of find my friends apps are partial to either iPhone or Android. But, why not try them out yourself? Everybody’s needs and tastes are different. Give my three favorite find my friend apps for Android and iPhone a try, if they suit you, great. If not, there are more options. Find one for you and keep a “leash” on your loved ones!</p><h2 id="Why-Your-WhatsApp-Location-is-Not-Updating-and-How-to-Fix-On-Tecno-Phantom-V-Flip"><a href="#Why-Your-WhatsApp-Location-is-Not-Updating-and-How-to-Fix-On-Tecno-Phantom-V-Flip" class="headerlink" title="Why Your WhatsApp Location is Not Updating and How to Fix On Tecno Phantom V Flip"></a>Why Your WhatsApp Location is Not Updating and How to Fix On Tecno Phantom V Flip</h2><p>WhatsApp is a free messaging app owned by Meta, initially Facebook.

How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?"></a>Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?</h2><p>Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you’re safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.</p><p>Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can’t be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.</p><p>So without wasting time, here’s how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:</p><p>Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.</p><p>Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.</p><p>Step 3. Now click the <strong>Attach</strong> button on the text field and click <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-1.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location"                ></p><p>Step 3.

So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere.

Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging.

Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

This means you don’t need to fork out some serious money for a VPN service. So, in this section, you’ll learn to fake a Facebook location on Android using the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en&gl=US" >Fake GPS location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app. It is a free program for teleporting your phone IP address to new places with a simple screen tap. Let’s see how to do that:</p><p>Step 1. Install and launch the Fake GPS location app on Android.</p><p>Step 2. Next, “allow mock locations” in your Android’s developer settings. To do that, open <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Additional Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Developer options</strong>. Then, click “<strong>Select mock location app</strong>“ before choosing <strong>Fake GPS</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/fake-gps-location-on-facebook-02.jpg"                      alt="fake gps on facebook settings"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now go to the Fake GPS location app and choose a new location for your device. If satisfied, tap <strong>Ok</strong> to save the added area you’d like your device to appear on.</p><p>Step 4. Finally, head to Facebook and change your location settings.</p><h2 id="Method-3-Create-A-Fake-Check-In-Location-on-Facebook"><a href="#Method-3-Create-A-Fake-Check-In-Location-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Create A Fake Check-In Location on Facebook"></a>Method 3: Create A Fake Check-In Location on Facebook</h2><p>Sometimes you might want to prank your Facebook friends with a new location announcement. In other words, you can make them believe that you’re in a particular location when in reality, you’re not. In that case, the Facebook Check-In feature will come in handy. It’s a simple but highly effective feature that adds your fake location to a Facebook post. Just think of it as a status update.</p><p>So, below is <strong>how to fake location on Facebook</strong> with the Check-In feature:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook on your favorite browser and tap the “<strong>What’s on your mind</strong>“ field.</p><p>Step 2. Next, tap the GPS icon. You’ll see all the locations near you. Or, key in a fake address and select it on the suggestions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/fake-gps-location-on-facebook-03.jpg"                      alt="fake address and tap gps icon"                ></p><p>Step 3.

This will enable Facebook to correctly tailor adverts, friends, and other recommendations based on your location. But unfortunately, it can be challenging to change the actual location unless you’re willing to spend top dollar on a VPN service. Put, you’ll need to spoof your IP address to change the exact location.</p><p>For this reason, I recommend using a fake location tool like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?"></a>Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?</h2><p>Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you’re safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.</p><p>Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can’t be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.</p><p>So without wasting time, here’s how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:</p><p>Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.</p><p>Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.</p><p>Step 3. Now click the <strong>Attach</strong> button on the text field and click <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-1.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location"                ></p><p>Step 3. Allow WhatsApp access to your device’s location and then press the <strong>Share Live Location</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-2.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location"                ></p><p>Step 3. Last but not least, set the duration your contact will view your location, add a comment, and tap the <strong>Send</strong> button. That’s it!</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> As you can see, WhatsApp relies on your GPS location to share your actual location. So, use Wondershare Dr.Fone to change your device’s location and then share it on WhatsApp.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-Common-WhatsApp-Issues-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-Common-WhatsApp-Issues-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix Common WhatsApp Issues on Android &amp; iPhone"></a>Part 5: How to Fix Common WhatsApp Issues on Android &amp; iPhone</h2><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone is the perfect tool to handle all your WhatsApp issues.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4.

It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Let’s see how to do that:</p><p>Step 1. Install and launch the Fake GPS location app on Android.</p><p>Step 2. Next, “allow mock locations” in your Android’s developer settings. To do that, open <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Additional Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Developer options</strong>. Then, click “<strong>Select mock location app</strong>“ before choosing <strong>Fake GPS</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/fake-gps-location-on-facebook-02.jpg"                      alt="fake gps on facebook settings"                ></p><p>Step 3.

In other words, you can make them believe that you’re in a particular location when in reality, you’re not. In that case, the Facebook Check-In feature will come in handy. It’s a simple but highly effective feature that adds your fake location to a Facebook post. Just think of it as a status update.</p><p>So, below is <strong>how to fake location on Facebook</strong> with the Check-In feature:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook on your favorite browser and tap the “<strong>What’s on your mind</strong>“ field.</p><p>Step 2. Next, tap the GPS icon. You’ll see all the locations near you. Or, key in a fake address and select it on the suggestions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/02/fake-gps-location-on-facebook-03.jpg"                      alt="fake address and tap gps icon"                ></p><p>Step 3.

This will enable Facebook to correctly tailor adverts, friends, and other recommendations based on your location. But unfortunately, it can be challenging to change the actual location unless you’re willing to spend top dollar on a VPN service. Put, you’ll need to spoof your IP address to change the exact location.</p><p>For this reason, I recommend using a fake location tool like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

It allows you to teleport your current location to anywhere in the world without jailbreaking your Honor 70 Lite 5G or spending top dollar on a VPN service. This lets you take full advantage of the “Nearby Friends” Facebook feature that needs your actual GPS location.</p><p>Below are the key features:</p><ul><li>Transfer phone location to any place in the world.</li><li>Intuitive and detailed zoom-in and zoom-out map.</li><li>Compatible with all iOS and Android versions.</li><li>Move to new locations on the map via different routes and means.</li><li>Compatible with location-based apps like Telegram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.</li></ul><p>Here is a video tutorial for you to learn and preview how to fake location on Facebook via Dr.Fone - Virtual Location</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/images/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><p>Below is how to fake location on Facebook for Android and iPhone using Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1.

It will ensure that no one, even your friends can see your Facebook dating profile. This hiding of the dating profile is automatic. So, don’t expect your friends who are using Facebook dating to notice that you are using the platform. In the same vein, don’t expect to see your friends who are using Facebook Dating.</p><h3 id="2-What-happens-when-you-like-someone-on-Facebook-Dating"><a href="#2-What-happens-when-you-like-someone-on-Facebook-Dating" class="headerlink" title="2.

What happens when you like someone on Facebook Dating?</h3><p>If you notice a profile that matches what you are looking for, Facebook Dating requires you to do something about it. You can choose to begin a conversation by either tapping the person’s photo or hitting the love icon. Let’s elaborate on how you do either of the two.</p><p><strong>Sending a Like</strong></p><ul><li>Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.</li><li>From the choices displayed, select the “Dating” Option.</li><li>Tap the love icon to send the like.</li></ul><p><strong>Starting a conversation</strong></p><ul><li>Upon opening your Facebook application, go to the hamburger menu.</li><li>From the choices displayed, select the “Dating” Option.</li><li>Tap the photo, write a message you deem fit, and send it.</li></ul><p>It is important to note that what happens after that solely depends on the other party.

After all, the feature automatically hides its users’ profiles. The simplest way of finding out is to rely on luck. Go ahead and join Facebook Dating and then wait for Facebook Dating to suggest that person. There are high chances of waiting long before knowing whether someone is on Facebook Dating. If they change their Facebook dating location, there is a possibility of never knowing.</p><p>That said and done, there are other more specific ways of identifying if that person is using Facebook Dating. If you can access their phone, grab it and check Facebook notifications. If you notice the likes of someone who liked you or has a crush on you, then that’s a Facebook Dating user. If the person doesn’t mind answering, go straight to the point and ask them. Other alternatives include spying on their phones and using online tools.</p><h3 id="4-Can-someone-see-once-you-read-a-message-sent-via-Facebook-Dating"><a href="#4-Can-someone-see-once-you-read-a-message-sent-via-Facebook-Dating" class="headerlink" title="4.Can someone see once you read a message sent via Facebook Dating?"></a>4.Can someone see once you read a message sent via Facebook Dating?</h3><p>Unfortunately, Facebook Dating doesn’t support read receipts. Your option is to keep waiting for the response until they respond or hope to forget about it altogether. For someone genuinely interested, the wait can be pretty frustrating. It could mean that the other parties are genuinely busy or not interested. If the case is the latter, the other party will most likely see the message and ignore it. Please tell him whether they have yet to see your message or chose not to respond.</p><h3 id="5-How-anonymous-is-a-Facebook-Dating-profile"><a href="#5-How-anonymous-is-a-Facebook-Dating-profile" class="headerlink" title="5.

Despite that being the case, anonymity is something you can’t expect from this platform. If someone gets lucky and sees your dating profile, recognizing you are pretty high. After all, your profile displays the name you use on Facebook.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>It is an excellent way of meeting new friends who live outside your residence area.

This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said.

But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3.

In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

With this feature, you can share your live location for whatever reasons you may have. For example, you may want to share your live location with your kids or vice-versa. Or, you might simply want to share a fake location on Viber with your nosy friends.</p><p>But as good as it sounds, this live location feature is enabled by default on your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+&#x2F;Android browser. Therefore, you can send a location on Viber without knowing. This can be advantageous to stalkers or even cause misunderstanding in your relationship. What’s worse, it shares your actual location with every text you send. But fret not because this post will help you <strong>disable or enable My Location on Viber</strong> according to your needs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-disable-or-enable-My-Location-on-Viber"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-disable-or-enable-My-Location-on-Viber" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to disable or enable My Location on Viber?"></a>Part 2: How to disable or enable My Location on Viber?</h2><p>So, without wasting too much time, let’s find out the steps to disable&#x2F;enable Viber location-sharing feature. It’s straightforward.</p><p>Step 1. Fire up your Viber app on mobile or PC and tap the <strong>Chats</strong> button.

Next, tap the <strong>Ellipsis</strong> (three dots) icon at the top-right corner of the screen and choose <strong>Chat Info</strong>. Alternatively, simply swipe the screen to the left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-2.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber, tap chat info"                ></p><p>Step 3. On the Chat Info window, simply enable or disable the <strong>Attach location always</strong> toggle. It’s done!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-3.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber to allow location sharing"                ></p><p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: You might be wondering how to share your actual Viber location with a chat or group. Again, this is very straightforward. Simply open the conversation and tap the three dots on the text field. Then, click the <strong>Share Location</strong> button and choose your location on the Google map. Lastly, tap <strong>Send location</strong> to share the Viber location with your selected contact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-4.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber share location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-send-a-fake-location-on-Viber-and-How"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-send-a-fake-location-on-Viber-and-How" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?"></a>Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?</h2><p>So, is it possible to <strong>Viber’s fake location</strong>? Unfortunately, Viber doesn’t allow users to share a different place from the real one. That’s because the app asks to automatically access your actual location data using Wi-Fi or GPS while signing up. Therefore, based on the permission you set yourself, the answer is NO.</p><p>But nothing is impossible in the tech world. You can easily instruct Viber to share a different location using a third-party app or service like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Let’s discuss some reasons to spoof location on this messaging app. Below are some common ones:</p><ul><li><strong>Protect your privacy</strong></li></ul><p> Many people don’t want other online users to have a clue of their actual whereabouts. If you’re one of them, use a third-party tool to spoof your Viber location on your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ or Android.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank your friends</strong></li></ul><p>Do you want to show your friends that you’re in London or New York when you’re in some remote village&#x2F;town somewhere in reality? Yes, that sounds cool!</p><ul><li><strong>Improve sales</strong></li></ul><p>If you’re a digital marketer, you might want to convince your potential clients that the goods are from a specific region or city close to them. Believe it or not, this can lead to more sales closures.</p><h3 id="Wrap-it-Up"><a href="#Wrap-it-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it Up"></a>Wrap it Up</h3><p>You can share your live location on Viber just like you would on Facebook, WhatsApp, and other social media apps.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4.

It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Several in-built apps and other installed apps use the iPhone location to make the user experience better. The settings help the iPhone owner decide which app gets to use his location and which one shouldn’t. It is quite easy to make the call and enable the settings under this section.</p><p>The in-built apps like ‘Camera’ use Location to add the time and date stamp to your images. They also detect where the photo is taken and provide appropriate tags to pinpoint the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/photo-with-time-date-stamp-pic2.jpg"                      alt="photo with date stamp"                ></p><p>Your ‘Reminder or Alarm’ apps also use location to send you notifications and pop-ups to intimate you that you’ve reached a specific location. If you have somewhere to be, they can also tell you how long it will take to be there. It completely depends on the type of app you are using.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/reminder-apps-iphone-pic3.jpg"                      alt="reminder app"                ></p><p>The Maps is one of the main apps that desperately rely on Location Settings. It tells where your favorite pub is, where the closest bookstore is and how to find the nearest Pharmacy in the locality. Name the necessity, and the Maps will find it for you. Letting this app access Location is important to get accurate results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/location-apps-pic4.jpg"                      alt="location apps"                ></p><p>Compass is another app that needs access to the location to tell you which direction the sun sets in.

Whenever you install a new app, the phone will ask you if it’s okay to share the Location. If you accept, that’s how it goes. If you deny, the apps cannot access your GPS. When you spoof iPhone Location, then these apps will register this fake location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Change-GPS-location-on-iPhone-using-a-PC-program"><a href="#Part-2-Change-GPS-location-on-iPhone-using-a-PC-program" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Change GPS location on iPhone using a PC program"></a>Part 2: Change GPS location on iPhone using a PC program</h2><p>The GPS Spoofing iPhone is very easy, especially when you go for a quick PC Program.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

It actually utilizes the GPS feature of your device to determine where you are located. This can sometimes be annoying as you may wish to access a filter or badge that is not available at your Geological location.

What Snapchat is using your location for?"></a>Part 1. What Snapchat is using your location for?</h2><p>Snapchat basically utilizes your location for the SnapMap feature that furnishes the location-based filters etc. over your device. This SnapMap feature was unveiled in 2017. If you haven’t deliberately enabled it yet or you’re unaware of this feature, implies that you’re still “off the grid”.

However, concerns about privacy and changing your location on Life360 are valid. Doing so might seem tempting, but it can undermine the app’s purpose. Here are alternatives for safety and communication without compromising privacy.</p><p>Designated Safe Zones</p><p>Set up safe zones such as home, school, or work, where location sharing is on. You can change your location on Life360 outside these zones. And turn off sharing for privacy while providing reassurance during crucial times.</p><p>Time-Based Sharing</p><p>Opt for temporary location sharing during activities or outings. That way, your loved ones can track your whereabouts without constant monitoring. You can also set a timer for location sharing to deactivate after the activity, so you don’t have to fake your location.</p><p>Location Bubble</p><p>Some Life360 plans offer location Bubble. It shares your general vicinity without revealing your exact coordinates. This provides a sense of security while maintaining a degree of privacy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/change-your-location-on-life-360-12.jpg"                      alt="life360 bubble feature"                ></p><p>Open Communication</p><p>Talk with your family about your concerns about location sharing. Explain your desire for more privacy while emphasizing your commitment to safety. Discuss boundaries and compromise on situations where location sharing feels necessary.</p><p>Consider Alternatives</p><p>Explore apps with granular privacy controls. Some focus on user privacy and allow for more customized sharing settings. Change your location on Life360 responsibly to balance safety and privacy.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, let’s go back to the main question. <strong>Can you change your location on Life360 without anyone knowing?</strong> Yes, it is possible to fake your location using spoofing apps for Android and iOS.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Yik Yak is a one-of-a-kind social media platform designed to help users connect with people through text-based posts.

Now, install and then open it to proceed.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> While the app is launched, tap on the “ENABLE” option located at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/enable-mock-location.jpg"                      alt="enable mock location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you will be directed to the Developer options page.

In case it gets detected by the company, your account may get banned as this is against the policy of any app.</li><li>The process of using the spoofer app to change Skout location can seem to be difficult and complex.</li><li>Some apps require you to root your device in order to let you proceed with spoofing properly.</li><li>When you spoof your location with the app too frequently, this may make your profile under suspicious activity monitoring.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Use-Tinder-instead"><a href="#Part-3-Use-Tinder-instead" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Use Tinder instead"></a>Part 3: Use Tinder instead</h2><p>Tinder has its own popularity among today’s generation and it has revolutionized the way of dating. If you are interested in faking location on a dating app, using Tinder will be our next suggestion. Unlike Skout, Tinder offers it own Tinder + feature in order to assist you in changing the location of your device. The condition is to subscribe the plan for Tinder +.</p><p>However, when you use Tinder +, you may feel it to be an expensive deal. On the other hand Skout is free to sign up. You need to be having a Facebook account in order to join Tinder whereas Skout doesn’t want any such requirement. Moreover, on Skout, you can have the meet tab with which you are allowed to see the photos of people and know the age.</p><p><strong>Here are the detailed steps on how you can change location.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Tinder in your Honor 100 as the first step. Upon launching it successfully, go to your profile icon and tap on it. You will find it at the top of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for the “Settings” option now and then choose “Get Tinder Plus” or “Tinder Gold”. You can now subscribe a plan and then Tinder + will be yours.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, again open the Tinder app followed by tapping on the profile icon.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Settings” and hit on “Swiping in” option. Next, tap on “Add a new location” and then you know what to do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/tinder+.jpg"                      alt="tinder plus"                ></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/3-things-you-must-know-about-fake-snapchat-location-on-honor-x50iplus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Things You Must Know about Fake Snapchat Location On Honor X50i+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-sharefake-location-on-whatsapp-for-realme-gt-neo-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Share/Fake Location on WhatsApp for Realme GT Neo 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-your-samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-5g-2023-location-on-life360-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Your Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G (2023) Location on life360 Without Anyone Knowing? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-leave-a-life360-group-on-tecno-spark-10-pro-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Leave a Life360 Group On Tecno Spark 10 Pro Without Anyone Knowing? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-simple-and-effective-ways-to-change-your-country-on-youtube-app-of-your-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Simple and Effective Ways to Change Your Country on YouTube App Of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/simple-and-effective-ways-to-change-your-country-on-youtube-app-of-your-oppo-reno-10-proplus-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Simple and Effective Ways to Change Your Country on YouTube App Of your Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-things-you-must-know-about-fake-snapchat-location-on-nokia-c32-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 3 Things You Must Know about Fake Snapchat Location On Nokia C32 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-snapchat-location-without-jailbreak-on-poco-f5-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Fake Snapchat Location without Jailbreak On Poco F5 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-changefake-your-oppo-a38-location-on-viber-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change/Fake Your Oppo A38 Location on Viber | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-detect-and-stop-mspy-from-spying-on-your-xiaomi-13t-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Detect and Stop mSpy from Spying on Your Xiaomi 13T Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-angling-images-a-comprehensive-instagram-rotation-handbook/"><u>[Updated] The Art of Angling Images  A Comprehensive Instagram Rotation Handbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-precision-screening-advanced-tips-for-hp-laptop-recording/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Precision Screening  Advanced Tips for HP Laptop Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-accelerate-your-channel-growth-affordable-subscribers-available/"><u>2024 Approved  Accelerate Your Channel Growth - Affordable Subscribers Available</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-error-connecting-to-the-apple-id-server-on-iphone-7-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Troubleshooting Error Connecting to the Apple ID Server On iPhone 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-turn-off-google-location-to-stop-tracking-you-on-tecno-spark-10c-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Turn Off Google Location to Stop Tracking You on Tecno Spark 10C | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-ps5-ssd-and-hdd-wonders-top-10-exteriors/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  PS5 SSD & HDD Wonders  Top 10 Exteriors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-high-gear-comparison-gopros-best-match-ghost-s-drift/"><u>In 2024, High Gear Comparison  GoPro's Best Match?

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Unfortunately, Viber doesn’t allow users to share a different place from the real one.

Therefore, based on the permission you set yourself, the answer is NO.</p><p>But nothing is impossible in the tech world. You can easily instruct Viber to share a different location using a third-party app or service like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

With this feature, you can share your live location for whatever reasons you may have. For example, you may want to share your live location with your kids or vice-versa. Or, you might simply want to share a fake location on Viber with your nosy friends.</p><p>But as good as it sounds, this live location feature is enabled by default on your Honor Play 8T&#x2F;Android browser.

It’s straightforward.</p><p>Step 1. Fire up your Viber app on mobile or PC and tap the <strong>Chats</strong> button.

Next, tap the <strong>Ellipsis</strong> (three dots) icon at the top-right corner of the screen and choose <strong>Chat Info</strong>. Alternatively, simply swipe the screen to the left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-2.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber, tap chat info"                ></p><p>Step 3. On the Chat Info window, simply enable or disable the <strong>Attach location always</strong> toggle. It’s done!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-3.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber to allow location sharing"                ></p><p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: You might be wondering how to share your actual Viber location with a chat or group. Again, this is very straightforward. Simply open the conversation and tap the three dots on the text field. Then, click the <strong>Share Location</strong> button and choose your location on the Google map. Lastly, tap <strong>Send location</strong> to share the Viber location with your selected contact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-4.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber share location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-send-a-fake-location-on-Viber-and-How"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-send-a-fake-location-on-Viber-and-How" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?"></a>Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?</h2><p>So, is it possible to <strong>Viber’s fake location</strong>? Unfortunately, Viber doesn’t allow users to share a different place from the real one. That’s because the app asks to automatically access your actual location data using Wi-Fi or GPS while signing up. Therefore, based on the permission you set yourself, the answer is NO.</p><p>But nothing is impossible in the tech world. You can easily instruct Viber to share a different location using a third-party app or service like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

But sometimes, you might want to <strong>change location on Viber</strong> to prank your friends or for security purposes. So, read on to learn how to <strong>fake location on Viber</strong> with some simple solutions.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-My-Location-feature-on-Viber"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-My-Location-feature-on-Viber" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the My Location feature on Viber?"></a>Part 1: What is the My Location feature on Viber?</h2><p>If you’ve used WhatsApp’s location feature before, you’ll know what Viber’s “My Location” is all about. With this feature, you can share your live location for whatever reasons you may have. For example, you may want to share your live location with your kids or vice-versa. Or, you might simply want to share a fake location on Viber with your nosy friends.</p><p>But as good as it sounds, this live location feature is enabled by default on your Itel P40+&#x2F;Android browser.

What’s worse, it shares your actual location with every text you send.

On the Chat Info window, simply enable or disable the <strong>Attach location always</strong> toggle. It’s done!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-3.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber to allow location sharing"                ></p><p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: You might be wondering how to share your actual Viber location with a chat or group.

Then, click the <strong>Share Location</strong> button and choose your location on the Google map. Lastly, tap <strong>Send location</strong> to share the Viber location with your selected contact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-4.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber share location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-send-a-fake-location-on-Viber-and-How"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-send-a-fake-location-on-Viber-and-How" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?"></a>Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?</h2><p>So, is it possible to <strong>Viber’s fake location</strong>? Unfortunately, Viber doesn’t allow users to share a different place from the real one. That’s because the app asks to automatically access your actual location data using Wi-Fi or GPS while signing up. Therefore, based on the permission you set yourself, the answer is NO.</p><p>But nothing is impossible in the tech world. You can easily instruct Viber to share a different location using a third-party app or service like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.
