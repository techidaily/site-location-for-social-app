Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?"></a>Part 4. How to Send Live Location on WhatsApp?</h2><p>Back in 2017, WhatsApp rolled out a brand-new feature that allows users to send their live location to family and friends. This location can come in handy if you want to meet up somewhere or let your friends and family know you’re safe and secure. And lest I forget, you can also use it to prank your friends.</p><p>Note, however, that WhatsApp only allows you to share your real-time location for 8 hours, 1 hour, or 15 minutes. In other words, this gives you control over how long users can see you on the map. Moreover, this information can’t be shared with anyone once you stop sharing.</p><p>So without wasting time, here’s how to send live location on WhatsApp for Android or iPhone:</p><p>Step 1. Enable the GPS service on your phone by clicking the GPS button on the control panel.</p><p>Step 2. Open WhatsApp and tap the group chat or individual chat with which you want to share the location.</p><p>Step 3. Now click the <strong>Attach</strong> button on the text field and click <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-1.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location"                ></p><p>Step 3. Allow WhatsApp access to your device’s location and then press the <strong>Share Live Location</strong> button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/whatsapp-location-not-updating-2.jpg"                      alt="whatsapp location not updating drfone virtual location"                ></p><p>Step 3. Last but not least, set the duration your contact will view your location, add a comment, and tap the <strong>Send</strong> button. That’s it!</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> As you can see, WhatsApp relies on your GPS location to share your actual location. So, use Wondershare Dr.Fone to change your device’s location and then share it on WhatsApp.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-Common-WhatsApp-Issues-on-Android-iPhone"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-Common-WhatsApp-Issues-on-Android-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix Common WhatsApp Issues on Android &amp; iPhone"></a>Part 5: How to Fix Common WhatsApp Issues on Android &amp; iPhone</h2><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone is the perfect tool to handle all your WhatsApp issues.

This app is free to download as well as works in a hassle-free way. However, if we talk about the steps, you will be a bit disappointed as the steps are lengthy for this as you will require downgrading Google Play services. Let us know what exactly we need to do.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> As mentioned, firstly, downgrade the Google Play services. Then, install the app in your Google Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once installed, make sure to disable the “Find My Device” option. You can do this by “Settings” &gt; “Security” &gt; “Device Administrations” and turn off the option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg"                      alt="android version about fgl pro"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Another thing to be noted after downgrading Google Play services is to uninstall the updates.

Tap “Install”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/virtual-loaction/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg"                      alt="tap install"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, go to “Settings” &gt; “Apps” and tap the menu. Choose “Show System” &gt; “Google Play Store” and disable it.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Now, you need to set the FGL Pro as a mock location app. Please make sure to enable Developer options first.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

But sometimes, you might want to <strong>change location on Viber</strong> to prank your friends or for security purposes. So, read on to learn how to <strong>fake location on Viber</strong> with some simple solutions.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-My-Location-feature-on-Viber"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-My-Location-feature-on-Viber" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the My Location feature on Viber?"></a>Part 1: What is the My Location feature on Viber?</h2><p>If you’ve used WhatsApp’s location feature before, you’ll know what Viber’s “My Location” is all about. With this feature, you can share your live location for whatever reasons you may have. For example, you may want to share your live location with your kids or vice-versa. Or, you might simply want to share a fake location on Viber with your nosy friends.</p><p>But as good as it sounds, this live location feature is enabled by default on your Xiaomi Redmi K70 Pro&#x2F;Android browser. Therefore, you can send a location on Viber without knowing. This can be advantageous to stalkers or even cause misunderstanding in your relationship. What’s worse, it shares your actual location with every text you send.

It’s straightforward.</p><p>Step 1. Fire up your Viber app on mobile or PC and tap the <strong>Chats</strong> button. Here, proceed to open a chat that you want to enable&#x2F;disable location sharing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-1.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber open chats"                ></p><p>Step 2. Next, tap the <strong>Ellipsis</strong> (three dots) icon at the top-right corner of the screen and choose <strong>Chat Info</strong>. Alternatively, simply swipe the screen to the left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-2.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber, tap chat info"                ></p><p>Step 3. On the Chat Info window, simply enable or disable the <strong>Attach location always</strong> toggle. It’s done!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-3.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber to allow location sharing"                ></p><p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: You might be wondering how to share your actual Viber location with a chat or group. Again, this is very straightforward. Simply open the conversation and tap the three dots on the text field. Then, click the <strong>Share Location</strong> button and choose your location on the Google map. Lastly, tap <strong>Send location</strong> to share the Viber location with your selected contact.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/change-location-on-viber-4.jpg"                      alt="change location on Viber share location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Can-I-send-a-fake-location-on-Viber-and-How"><a href="#Part-3-Can-I-send-a-fake-location-on-Viber-and-How" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?"></a>Part 3: Can I send a fake location on Viber, and How?</h2><p>So, is it possible to <strong>Viber’s fake location</strong>? Unfortunately, Viber doesn’t allow users to share a different place from the real one. That’s because the app asks to automatically access your actual location data using Wi-Fi or GPS while signing up. Therefore, based on the permission you set yourself, the answer is NO.</p><p>But nothing is impossible in the tech world. You can easily instruct Viber to share a different location using a third-party app or service like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location.

This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location.

The marker will automatically land on the map.

So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3.

In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Once the app is installed, launch it and tap on the Virtual Location option from the home interface.</p><p>Step 2: Enter the fake location in the search box and let the software detect the location. The marker will automatically land on the map. Tap on the “Move Here” option on the screen, and your Vivo Y100 5G location will instantly move to that particular location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/10/move-location-on-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="Move Here option"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, launch the WhatsApp app and click on the Share Location option.

Hit on “Go” when you’re done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p>Step 5: A few moments later, the system will perceive the desired location you have entered.

Change Snapchat Location using Xcode (complex)"></a>4.2. Change Snapchat Location using Xcode (complex)</h3><p>Now, if we talk about fake location for Snapchat map on iPhone, it’s not as easy as it looks. You need to be an extremely tech-savvy person to <strong>fake Snapchat location without jailbreaking</strong> your Vivo Y100 5G. You simply can’t download a Snapchat location spoofer app over your Vivo Y100 5G and fake it. But fret not, we’re glad to bring you a detailed tutorial with which you can easily perform location spoofing on Snapchat and that too, without jailbreaking your Vivo Y100 5G.</p><p>Step 1: Install Xcode and Set up a Dummy app</p><ol><li><p>Grab your Mac computer first and then head over to the App Store. Now, look for the Xcode application and get it installed on your computer.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-5.jpg"                      alt="look for Xcode"                ></p></li><li><p>Once the application is installed, launch it over. The Xcode window will come up over your screen. Now, set up a new project and select “single view application” followed by hitting “Next”.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-6.jpg"                      alt="setup a new project"                ></p></li><li><p>Then, give a name to your project, for instance, “GeoSpy” and hit on the “Next” button.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-7.jpg"                      alt="GeoSpy"                ></p></li></ol><p>Step 2: Setup GIT on Xcode</p><ol><li><p>On the upcoming screen, Xcode will throw up a pop-up message stating “Please tell me who you are” and some GIT commands that you need to execute.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-8.jpg"                      alt="Setup GIT"                ></p></li><li><p>For this, fire up the “Terminal”over your Mac and then execute the commands as follows:</p></li></ol><ul><li>git config –global user.email “<a class="link"   href="mailto:&#x79;&#111;&#x75;&#x40;&#101;&#x78;&#97;&#x6d;&#112;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;" >&#x79;&#111;&#x75;&#x40;&#101;&#x78;&#97;&#x6d;&#112;&#x6c;&#x65;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“</li><li>git config –global user.name “your name”</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> Change the values for “<a class="link"   href="mailto:&#121;&#111;&#117;&#x40;&#x65;&#120;&#97;&#109;&#x70;&#108;&#x65;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;" >&#121;&#111;&#117;&#x40;&#x65;&#120;&#97;&#109;&#x70;&#108;&#x65;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>”and “your name” with your information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-9.jpg"                      alt="Change the values"                ></p><ol start="6"><li><p>Next, you need to make sure that to set up a development team and meanwhile, connect your Vivo Y100 5G to your Mac computer.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-10.jpg"                      alt="connect iphone to mac"                ></p></li><li><p>Once done, opt it in as the build device and while you do it, ensure to keep it unlocked.</p></li><li><p>Lastly, if everything is performed correctly, Xcode will now process some symbol files, please be patient and wait for it to complete.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-11.jpg"                      alt="process some symbol files"                ></p></li></ol><p>Step 3: Move Bitmoji</p><p>Now, you’re all set to fake location for Snapchat map. For this, simply hit on the “Debug” menu and then opt for “Simulate Location” from the drop-down window. Lastly, select the location from the list as per your preference and you’re done.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-fake-Snapchat-location-on-Android"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-fake-Snapchat-location-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. How to fake Snapchat location on Android"></a>Part 5. How to fake Snapchat location on Android</h2><p>Last but not least, the next method to fake Snapchat location is for Android devices. For this, you need to download a Snapchat spoof app (easily available over Google Play Store) on your Vivo Y100 5G. Here’s all that you need to do.</p><ol><li><p>Head to the Google Play Store and then look for the “fake GPS” app. You may be provided with several similar options, be it free or paid. If you get along with any other app, it may require your Vivo Y100 5G to be rooted.</p></li><li><p>You need to opt for the “Fakegps free” app for Snapchat. This app doesn’t require you to root your Android. But ensure that you are running on Android version 6.0 or higher.</p></li><li><p>Install the Fake GPS Free app for Snapchat and then launch it afterwards. On the main screen, you’ll be asked to“ENABLE MOCK LOCATIONS”. Hit on it and you’ll be redirected to the“Developer options” screen.</p></li><li><p>Here, you need to simply tap on the “Select Mock Location App” option and opt for “FakeGPS Free” from the list of options appearing.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-12.jpg"                      alt="FakeGPS Free"                ></p></li></ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> You may need to enable the “Developer options” first to access these settings. For this, head to the “Settings”&gt;“About Phone”&gt; hit on “Build Number” – x7 times.</p><ol start="6"><li><p>Once done with enabling mock location, hit the back button on your touch screen to retreat back to the Fake GPS Free app.</p></li><li><p>Now, hit on the “Search” icon over the top to find the desired location. Or, simply double tap over the map on your desired location to drop the pin.</p></li><li><p>Lastly, hit the “play” button available over the right bottom of your screen to activate the fake GPS location for Snapchat.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-13.jpg"                      alt="activate the fake gps location"                ></p></li></ol><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>While reaching towards the end of the article, we are pretty sure that you now fully understand what it takes to <strong>fake Snapchat location</strong> on Android or iPhone.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Besides sharing Snaps by the Our Story feature, Snap Maps lets other Snapchatters see your real-time location using Bitmojis. That said, Ghost Mode makes you invisible on the Snap Map. In other words, no one can know where you are. Cool!</p><h3 id="Q2-What-are-the-differences-between-Ghost-Mode-and-disabling-Location-Filters"><a href="#Q2-What-are-the-differences-between-Ghost-Mode-and-disabling-Location-Filters" class="headerlink" title="Q2: What are the differences between Ghost Mode and disabling Location Filters?"></a>Q2: What are the differences between Ghost Mode and disabling Location Filters?</h3><p>The Ghost Mode makes you invisible for a specific duration or until you disable it. To use this feature, you don’t have to turn off the location feature on your smartphone. On the other hand, you just need to disable the Location Filters settings on Snapchat to turn off sharing your location tag on posts.</p><h3 id="Q3-How-accurate-is-the-Snapchat-map"><a href="#Q3-How-accurate-is-the-Snapchat-map" class="headerlink" title="Q3: How accurate is the Snapchat map?"></a>Q3: How accurate is the Snapchat map?</h3><p>Very accurate! Snapchat uses your GPS coordinates to determine your actual location on the map. However, this map gives a location based on where you were last seen when you logged into the app. So, if you stay for a long without opening the app, it won’t update your location. But if you log in and your location service is enabled, this app will auto-update it.</p><h3 id="Q4-How-does-Snapchat-Get-Information-on-Your-Location"><a href="#Q4-How-does-Snapchat-Get-Information-on-Your-Location" class="headerlink" title="Q4: How does Snapchat Get Information on Your Location?"></a>Q4: How does Snapchat Get Information on Your Location?</h3><p>While installing the Snapchat app and creating an account, the app will practically ask you to allow it to access your location. The app will use your phone’s GPS coordinates to determine your actual location. Also, your Wi-Fi connection will tell Snapchat exactly where you are.</p><h3 id="Q5-How-to-find-someone-in-Ghost-Mode-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Q5-How-to-find-someone-in-Ghost-Mode-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Q5: How to find someone in Ghost Mode on Snapchat?"></a>Q5: How to find someone in Ghost Mode on Snapchat?</h3><p>Sometimes you might want to urgently find a friend on Snapchat when you are in Ghost Mode. To do that, deactivate Ghost Mode on Snapchat by clicking Profile &gt; Settings &gt; See My Location and disabling Ghost Mode. Now open the Snap Map, and you’ll see your location with a red Bitmoji. You’ll also see your nearby friends with enabled Snapchat locations on the map. If you can’t find them, tap the Search icon, choose or enter their name, and see them on the map or send a text.</p><h3 id="Wrap-it-Up-1"><a href="#Wrap-it-Up-1" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it Up"></a>Wrap it Up</h3><p>Now you have a complete idea of what the Snapchat location filter is. In short, it is simply a creative way to share your Snapchat location tag on a post. But because you can’t spoof your location on Snapchat, I recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to teleport your Snapchat location to anywhere in the world.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Download history on the App Store"></a>1. Download history on the App Store</h4><p>Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called <strong>System Update</strong>. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users’ devices to the operators’ servers. It’s important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra.</p><h4 id="2-Unusually-High-Data-Usage"><a href="#2-Unusually-High-Data-Usage" class="headerlink" title="2.

To check the mobile data on your ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra, you need to go to <strong>Settings</strong> and click on <strong>Mobile Data</strong>. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user’s average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.</p><h4 id="3-Have-Access-to-Your-Device’s-Microphone-or-Camera"><a href="#3-Have-Access-to-Your-Device’s-Microphone-or-Camera" class="headerlink" title="3.

On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your ZTE Nubia Z60 Ultra’s camera or microphone.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Send-and-Fake-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-Of-your-Xiaomi-13-Ultra"><a href="#How-to-Send-and-Fake-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-Of-your-Xiaomi-13-Ultra" class="headerlink" title="How to Send and Fake Live Location on Facebook Messenger Of your Xiaomi 13 Ultra"></a>How to Send and Fake Live Location on Facebook Messenger Of your Xiaomi 13 Ultra</h2><p>Do you want to learn how to fake a live location on Messenger? Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

But, how to keep track of all of your friends, while some of them are die-hard apple fanatics and others are android geeks? Well, you do not need to tell others about those anymore, as we are going to talk about three fabulous cross-platform apps for finding friends.</p><h3 id="2-1-Find-my-friends"><a href="#2-1-Find-my-friends" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Find my friends"></a>2.1 Find my friends</h3><p>This app is straightforward and pretty simple to use. You can look at the map and find your friends at any time. Your friends also can keep track of you. SO, if security is your concern,” “Find my friend” is perfect for you. You can also chat with friends while they are on route.</p><p>You can also issue an alert to your friends whenever you are in an emergency. All your loved ones will get the address details, current time, and the remaining battery life. If your group has a mix of Android, iOS, and Blackberry, this app is excellent for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/find-my-friends.jpg"                      alt="find my friends"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Familo"><a href="#2-2-Familo" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Familo"></a>2.2 Familo</h3><p>Familo is the best working “finding friend” app. The app is regularly updated, and you can sign up with a phone number. You don’t need Facebook or any username to use this app. You have to create a group and invite others. If they sign up, you will get their location details at any time of the day. Of course, they have to approve it first!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/familio-app.jpg"                      alt="familio app"                ></p><h3 id="2-3-Glympse"><a href="#2-3-Glympse" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Glympse"></a>2.3 Glympse</h3><p>What makes Glympse different from others is the fact that you don’t even need to sign up here! You can set up a group for a specific time, and share your location to anyone you want to. You can even share your places via the web. If you wish to track your friends temporarily or contact someone for a specific period, Glympse is the right choice for you. And, if someone is not comfortable with the idea of location sharing, you can send your location via the web. They can use the shared link to know your area without ever installing the app. But, if you want to check up on your loved ones continually, then Glympse cannot satisfy your demand. As a temporary service, your location sharing link will be activated for four hours at most.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/glympse-app.jpg"                      alt="glympse app"                ></p><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Remember, there are several other find my friends apps in the app store, which can entice you. Some of them have pretty neat features. But, they can drain your battery too fast; others can be pretty limited on their free version. And, many of find my friends apps are partial to either iPhone or Android. But, why not try them out yourself? Everybody’s needs and tastes are different. Give my three favorite find my friend apps for Android and iPhone a try, if they suit you, great. If not, there are more options. Find one for you and keep a “leash” on your loved ones!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-realme-gt-5-pro-location-on-skout-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Realme GT 5 Pro Location on Skout | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-gps-location-on-infinix-smart-8-pro-easily-and-safely-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change GPS Location on Infinix Smart 8 Pro Easily & Safely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-asus-rog-phone-8-pro-location-on-twitter-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change your Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Location on Twitter | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-hidefake-snapchat-location-on-your-vivo-y56-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Hide/Fake Snapchat Location on Your Vivo Y56 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-activate-and-use-life360-ghost-mode-on-asus-rog-phone-7-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Activate and Use Life360 Ghost Mode On Asus ROG Phone 7 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-detect-and-stop-mspy-from-spying-on-your-realme-11-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Detect and Stop mSpy from Spying on Your Realme 11 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/4-most-known-ways-to-find-someone-on-tinder-for-oppo-f23-5g-by-name-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>4 Most-Known Ways to Find Someone on Tinder For Oppo F23 5G by Name | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-activate-and-use-life360-ghost-mode-on-google-pixel-8-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Activate and Use Life360 Ghost Mode On Google Pixel 8 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-send-and-fake-live-location-on-facebook-messenger-of-your-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Send and Fake Live Location on Facebook Messenger Of your Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-hassle-free-solutions-to-fake-location-on-find-my-friends-of-samsung-galaxy-m34-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Hassle-Free Solutions to Fake Location on Find My Friends Of Samsung Galaxy M34 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-on-the-go-editing-the-top-10-mobile-video-editors-for-iphone-and-android-devices/"><u>Updated On-the-Go Editing The Top 10 Mobile Video Editors for iPhone and Android Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-prime-web-gems-crafting-unique-wrapped-masterpieces/"><u>In 2024, Prime Web Gems  Crafting Unique Wrapped Masterpieces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/why-apple-account-disabled-on-your-iphone-11-pro-how-to-fix-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Why Apple Account Disabled On your iPhone 11 Pro?

But as soon as you quit the app, the last known location of your Bitmoji is displayed over the SnapMap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-2.jpg"                      alt="your Bitmoji on SnapMap"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-people-want-to-hide-fake-location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-2-Why-people-want-to-hide-fake-location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why people want to hide&#x2F;fake location on Snapchat?"></a>Part 2. Why people want to hide&#x2F;fake location on Snapchat?</h2><p>When it comes to <strong>fake Snapchat location</strong> there can be several reasons behind that. Here are some scenarios where people do wish to hide&#x2F;fake location on Snapchat. Let’s explore.</p><ul><li>Sometimes, you may wish to utilize the cute filter that you saw your favorite celebrity putting up when he&#x2F;she was in Sydney, Australia (or any other location).</li><li>Or, you may wish to simply spoof location Snapchat for fun and be popular among your friends that you know some really cool tricks.</li><li>Perhaps, you wish to stay ahead one step ahead in the dating game. For instance, you’re planning to move to a location a hundred miles away, and wish to have a person to spend quality time with when you reach there.</li><li>Another reason is that is absolutely fun to trick people into believing that you’re spending your leisure time on an expensive tour. For instance, you can check in to a classy restaurant (you’ve never been to in real) in Dubai by mocking the GPS location.</li><li>Even better for the kids who wish to fake GPS location to hide their real location over the location-sharing SnapMap feature from their parents, family, or friends.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-hide-location-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-hide-location-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to hide location on Snapchat"></a>Part 3. How to hide location on Snapchat</h2><p>When it comes to disabling or hiding the location on Snapchat, the tutorial is extremely easy. Snapchat itself offers you a setting called Ghost mode. You just need to enable it. Here’s how to get it done.</p><ol><li><p>First, get into the Snapchat app and then visit either the Discover screen or the Camera or Friends. Next, tap on the magnifying glass and hit on Map.</p></li><li><p>As soon as the SnapMap screen loads up, you need to access the settings by hitting the Gear icon on the top right corner.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-3.jpg"                      alt="start Ghost Mode"                ></p></li><li><p>Then, make use of the settings to set up your privacy and hit on the “Ghost Mode” toggle switch to turn it on. A pop-up window will appear with 3 different settings:</p></li></ol><ul><li>3 hours : Ghost mode is turned on for 3 straight hours.</li><li>24 hours : Ghost mode is turned on for 24 straight hours.</li><li>Until Turned Off : Ghost mode is turned on until you manually turn it off.</li></ul><ol start="5"><li><p>Selecting either of the aforementioned settings will hide your location from SnapMap. Implies, other than you no one will be able to locate you over SnapMap.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/fake-snapchat-location-4.jpg"                      alt="Ghost Mode settings"                ></p></li></ol><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-fake-Snapchat-location-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-fake-Snapchat-location-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

After this, you need to enter the location where you desire to teleport in the blank field given on the upper left. Hit on “Go” when you’re done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p>Step 5: A few moments later, the system will perceive the desired location you have entered. A pop-up box will come up where the distance will be shown. Click on the “Move Here” option in the box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="distance shown"                ></p><p>Step 6: This is it!

Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3.

In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Send-and-Fake-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-Of-your-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70E"><a href="#How-to-Send-and-Fake-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-Of-your-Xiaomi-Redmi-K70E" class="headerlink" title="How to Send and Fake Live Location on Facebook Messenger Of your Xiaomi Redmi K70E"></a>How to Send and Fake Live Location on Facebook Messenger Of your Xiaomi Redmi K70E</h2><p>Do you want to learn how to fake a live location on Messenger? Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

One such software is mSpy. Technically, mSpy is made as a business and parental monitoring app at first. But now, it is also used as a spy app that lets you look into someone else’s mobile phone or device.</p><p>Spying should not be misunderstood here as this app focuses mainly on checking employees’ devices or kids’ phones. It could be hard to discover since mSpy secretly works in the background. It monitors messages, phone calls, location, social media activity, and other device usages. Different features offered by mSpy are <strong>mSpy parental control, mSpy Instagram tracker, mSpy WhatsApp tracker</strong>, etc.</p><p>The process of detecting mSpy varies from different phone systems, Android or iPhone. Moreover, mSpy is a background app, so you can not normally see if it is installed on your phone or not. But don’t worry, we will help you out with how to detect mSpy. Below we have listed the two detection methods separately.</p><h3 id="How-to-Detect-mSpy-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#How-to-Detect-mSpy-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices"></a>How to Detect mSpy on Android Devices</h3><p>For detecting mSpy on an Android phone, that’ll be more direct if you check Update Service through the phone settings.

Download history on the App Store"></a>1. Download history on the App Store</h4><p>Certain apps masquerade as unharmful but turn out to be spyware. Recently, the malware was found in an app called <strong>System Update</strong>. That app was installed outside of App Store. After installation, the app hid and exfiltrated data from the users’ devices to the operators’ servers. It’s important to note which apps every user is hiding in their phone. Go to the App Store and download the history. This will help you figure out which apps have recently been downloaded on your Xiaomi Redmi K70E.</p><h4 id="2-Unusually-High-Data-Usage"><a href="#2-Unusually-High-Data-Usage" class="headerlink" title="2.

To check the mobile data on your Xiaomi Redmi K70E, you need to go to <strong>Settings</strong> and click on <strong>Mobile Data</strong>. You will be to see your overall data usage. Scroll down to know how much mobile data individual apps are using. Suppose any user’s average internet usage is around 200 MB per day, and suddenly it increases rapidly to about 800MB per day with the exact usage of the internet. In that case, the user has to be aware as something is fishy.</p><h4 id="3-Have-Access-to-Your-Device’s-Microphone-or-Camera"><a href="#3-Have-Access-to-Your-Device’s-Microphone-or-Camera" class="headerlink" title="3.

Have Access to Your Device’s Microphone or Camera</h4><p>When an app uses the microphone on iPhones, you will see an orange dot at the top of your screen and, similarly, a green dot for the camera. On Android phones, when an app starts, you will see a microphone or camera icon popup in the top right corner, which then turns into a green dot. These are healthy indicators that you should not ignore. Also, go to the list of apps that are allowed to access your Xiaomi Redmi K70E’s camera or microphone. If you see mSpy there, that means your phone is being spied on.</p><h4 id="4-Increased-Device-Shut-Down-Time"><a href="#4-Increased-Device-Shut-Down-Time" class="headerlink" title="4.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3.

It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1.

Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Tap on it and scroll to the build number. Tap on it 7 times and you will see the developer options getting enabled on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> As we are using Android, you need to head to the Google Play Store and look for the app on it. Now, install and then open it to proceed.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> While the app is launched, tap on the “ENABLE” option located at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/enable-mock-location.jpg"                      alt="enable mock location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you will be directed to the Developer options page.

If you are interested in faking location on a dating app, using Tinder will be our next suggestion. Unlike Skout, Tinder offers it own Tinder + feature in order to assist you in changing the location of your device. The condition is to subscribe the plan for Tinder +.</p><p>However, when you use Tinder +, you may feel it to be an expensive deal. On the other hand Skout is free to sign up. You need to be having a Facebook account in order to join Tinder whereas Skout doesn’t want any such requirement. Moreover, on Skout, you can have the meet tab with which you are allowed to see the photos of people and know the age.</p><p><strong>Here are the detailed steps on how you can change location.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Tinder in your Vivo Y78t as the first step. Upon launching it successfully, go to your profile icon and tap on it. You will find it at the top of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for the “Settings” option now and then choose “Get Tinder Plus” or “Tinder Gold”. You can now subscribe a plan and then Tinder + will be yours.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, again open the Tinder app followed by tapping on the profile icon.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Settings” and hit on “Swiping in” option. Next, tap on “Add a new location” and then you know what to do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/11/tinder+.jpg"                      alt="tinder plus"                ></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-pause-life360-location-sharing-for-htc-u23-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Pause Life360 Location Sharing For HTC U23 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/does-apple-iphone-xs-max-have-find-my-friends-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Does Apple iPhone XS Max Have Find My Friends?

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Here’s the perfect learning spot. These days, many situations can compel you to spoof location on Facebook Messenger. But as simple as it sounds, you might need to invest in a costly VPN. Facebook requests permission to track your actual GPS location when installing the app or creating an account. But fret not because you don’t even need a VPN service to change your Facebook location. This post will show you several shortcuts on how to send a fake location on Messenger.</p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-1-The-Benefits-of-Changing-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 1: The Benefits of Changing Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>There are numerous reasons to learn how to send fake locations on Messenger, just as initially said. Here are some of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Business awareness</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes, you might want your customers to believe that your products or offices are in a specific location. In that case, spoofing your live location on Messenger is a great idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Prank friends and have fun</strong></li></ul><p>There’s nothing wrong with fooling your Facebook friends about your location. You can show them that you’re in a unique spot when you’re just around them.</p><ul><li><strong>Hide identity</strong></li></ul><p>Your online security is paramount. And one way to protect yourself from online sniffers is by spoofing live locations on Facebook Messenger.</p><ul><li><strong>Make new friends</strong></li></ul><p>Often, Facebook will tailor its friend suggestions to people close to your proximity, thanks to the “Nearby Friends” feature. But you can start getting new and refreshing tips from people in your new location.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger"></a>Part 2: How to Change Location on Facebook Messenger</h2><p>After learning some reasons to fake location on Messenger, let’s now know how to do that with easy steps. You don’t need third-party help to <strong>mock live locations on Messenger on Android</strong> or iPhone. That’s because the app boasts its inbuilt location feature. Follow me:</p><p>Step 1. Open Facebook Messenger and launch the conversation with which you want to share the fake location.</p><p>Step 2. Click the “four dots” at the bottom-left corner and tap <strong>Location</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/03/facebook-messenger-location-sharing.jpg"                      alt="facebook messenger location sharing"                ></p><p>Step 3. Now tap <strong>Allow Location</strong> and choose a new location on the world map that appears.</p><p>Step 4. After choosing a location, tap <strong>Send Location</strong> to share it with your selected friend. It’s that easy!</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-a-Live-Location-on-Facebook-Messenger-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]"></a>Part 3: How to Change a Live Location on Facebook Messenger [iOS &amp; Android]</h2><p>As you can see, sending a pinned location directly on Messenger is only good if you want to share the place with a specific contact. In other words, you can’t natively spoof the location of multiple contacts on Messenger. So, if you want to <strong>fake live location on Messenger on iOS</strong> and Android, using a robust option like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a good idea.</p><p>With this virtual location tool, you can change your GPS location anywhere. That makes it helpful if you want to brag about your actual location with some tangible proof. Another thing, you can simulate location movements by choosing a particular route or transport. In addition to Facebook, Dr.Fone also works with apps like <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >Pokemon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/how-to-change-region-on-instagram.html" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-location-on-facebook.html" >Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, etc., etc.</p><p>You can check out the this video for further instruction.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Here’s how to fake live location on Messenger with Dr.Fone:</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download Dr.Fone and fire it up.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="home page"                ></p><p>Start by downloading and installing Dr.Fone from the official website and launch the software on your Mac or Windows PC. Then, connect your smartphone to the PC using a USB wire. Please ensure to select the “Transfer Files” option.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Launch the Virtual Location tool and enable USB debugging.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-ios-1.png"                      alt="connect phone with virtual location"                ></p><p>On Dr.Fone’s home page, press the Virtual Location tab and click <strong>Get Started</strong>. Now enable USB debugging to connect your phone to Dr.Fone. On Android, click Additional Settings &gt; Developer options &gt;USB debugging. Also, remember to set Dr.Fone as the mock location app.</p><p><strong>Step 3. Launch the map and choose a fake location for Messenger.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search a location on virtual location and go"                ></p><p>Once USB debugging is enabled, press <strong>Next</strong> to launch the map. Now enter your new location’s address or GPS coordinates and tap <strong>Move Here</strong>. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="move here on virtual location"                ></p><p><em><strong>Bonus tip: How to make your new Messenger location more believable</strong></em></p><p>Want to make your new location more believable? Simple, Dr.Fone will help you with that. Just enter the new coordinates or location on Dr.Fone and take a screenshot of the new area. Of course, you can find dozens of free location pictures on Google. After that, open the image on Facebook and tap the “location” icon. Now search and select your new location and post the picture.</p><p>Up to this point, you shouldn’t have any qualms spoofing your live location on Facebook Messenger. For example, if you want to send a pinned GPS coordinate to a single contact on Messenger, then simply use the inbuilt function to change location. However, your new location might not be believable since your actual device location will remain the same. In other words, there’s no proof that you’re actually in that particular location.</p><p>So, use Dr.Fone to fake location on Messenger with unreal precision. This third-party location changer allows you to teleport your location to anywhere. You can even change Messenger location by walking, driving, or cycling. Then to make it more believable, you can share a post with a screenshot of your new location. Remember, your new location will be visible to all your Facebook friends.</p><h2 id="Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services"><a href="#Part-5-FAQ-What-People-Also-Ask-about-Facebook-Location-Services" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Besides sharing Snaps by the Our Story feature, Snap Maps lets other Snapchatters see your real-time location using Bitmojis. That said, Ghost Mode makes you invisible on the Snap Map. In other words, no one can know where you are. Cool!</p><h3 id="Q2-What-are-the-differences-between-Ghost-Mode-and-disabling-Location-Filters"><a href="#Q2-What-are-the-differences-between-Ghost-Mode-and-disabling-Location-Filters" class="headerlink" title="Q2: What are the differences between Ghost Mode and disabling Location Filters?"></a>Q2: What are the differences between Ghost Mode and disabling Location Filters?</h3><p>The Ghost Mode makes you invisible for a specific duration or until you disable it. To use this feature, you don’t have to turn off the location feature on your smartphone. On the other hand, you just need to disable the Location Filters settings on Snapchat to turn off sharing your location tag on posts.</p><h3 id="Q3-How-accurate-is-the-Snapchat-map"><a href="#Q3-How-accurate-is-the-Snapchat-map" class="headerlink" title="Q3: How accurate is the Snapchat map?"></a>Q3: How accurate is the Snapchat map?</h3><p>Very accurate! Snapchat uses your GPS coordinates to determine your actual location on the map. However, this map gives a location based on where you were last seen when you logged into the app. So, if you stay for a long without opening the app, it won’t update your location. But if you log in and your location service is enabled, this app will auto-update it.</p><h3 id="Q4-How-does-Snapchat-Get-Information-on-Your-Location"><a href="#Q4-How-does-Snapchat-Get-Information-on-Your-Location" class="headerlink" title="Q4: How does Snapchat Get Information on Your Location?"></a>Q4: How does Snapchat Get Information on Your Location?</h3><p>While installing the Snapchat app and creating an account, the app will practically ask you to allow it to access your location. The app will use your phone’s GPS coordinates to determine your actual location. Also, your Wi-Fi connection will tell Snapchat exactly where you are.</p><h3 id="Q5-How-to-find-someone-in-Ghost-Mode-on-Snapchat"><a href="#Q5-How-to-find-someone-in-Ghost-Mode-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Q5: How to find someone in Ghost Mode on Snapchat?"></a>Q5: How to find someone in Ghost Mode on Snapchat?</h3><p>Sometimes you might want to urgently find a friend on Snapchat when you are in Ghost Mode. To do that, deactivate Ghost Mode on Snapchat by clicking Profile &gt; Settings &gt; See My Location and disabling Ghost Mode. Now open the Snap Map, and you’ll see your location with a red Bitmoji. You’ll also see your nearby friends with enabled Snapchat locations on the map. If you can’t find them, tap the Search icon, choose or enter their name, and see them on the map or send a text.</p><h3 id="Wrap-it-Up"><a href="#Wrap-it-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it Up"></a>Wrap it Up</h3><p>Now you have a complete idea of what the Snapchat location filter is.
